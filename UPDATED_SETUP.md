# Wirom2.0 Setup Manual

This is the temporary setup manual for Wirom2.0

## Required installations

### Webots
Install this version of Webots: https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2021b

### Python:
Download Python 3.9 from their website: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3912/ 
#### Note:
We are using this version because Webots only supports up to Python 3.9. Even though the controllers are not implemented through the editor in Webots, itâ€™s best to use the same version to make sure that they are compatible. 


### Node.js / npm:
Downloaded from: https://nodejs.org/en/ 

### RabbitMQ:
Choose the correct operating system from: 
https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html \
With MacOS it is recommended to use the *Homebrew* package installer.\
On Windows it is recommended to either use the *Chocolatey* package manager or use the installer as an administrative user. 

### Command Line Interface: 
To follow along the next steps, you need to use command line interface. \
On Windows, I have mainly been using the Windows Terminal: \

MacOS users can use the Terminal command line. 

### Cloning the repository
To download the source code, clone the repository to your machine using the command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/gunnarkleiven/WiRoM2.0.git
```
To run the system, you need to run 3 processes:
-	The web interface
-	The backend Server
-	Webots simulator

## Running the web interface 
Navigate to the *web_interface* folder:
```
cd Wirom2.0/web_interface
```
Before running it for the first time, you need to install the required packages by running the command
```
npm install
```
After this, start the web interface by running
```
npm start
```

## Running the flask (Python) server
Navigate to the proper folder by the command
```
cd Wirom2.0/backend
```
To help manage the different dependencies, it is useful to create a Python virtual environment. When you install it for the first time, run the following command on **Windows**
```
python -m venv .venv
```
or on **macOS/Linux**:
```
python3 -m venv .venv

```
The last argument is the name of the directory of the environment, in this case *".venv"* \
\
To initiate the virtual environment, run the command \
On **Windows**
```
./.venv/Scripts/activate
```
on **Mac**
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

After this, you need to install the dependencies. This is done with the command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next step is to set the Flask environment variable, using the command
On **Windows**
```
$env:FLASK_APP = "backend"
```
On **MacOS**
```
export FLASK_APP=backend
```
Finally, navigate one folder up
```
cd ..
```
And then start the server
```
flask run
```
